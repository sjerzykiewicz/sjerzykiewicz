# Hi, I'm Sebastian 👋

R&D Software Engineer working on large-scale data infrastructure, distributed processing systems, and applied AI research.

## About me

I work in an R&D environment where I design, improve, and migrate data systems.  
My daily work involves distributed data processing, storage engines, and reliability of data pipelines.

At the same time, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on reducing factual errors in language models.

## Areas of interest

- Distributed data systems
- Data warehouses and storage engines
- Reliability and correctness in data pipelines
- AI reliability and hallucination reduction
- Performance optimization and system design

## Technologies I work with

**Data & Distributed Systems**
- Apache Spark
- Iceberg
- Kafka
- ClickHouse / StarRocks

**Infrastructure**
- Kubernetes
- Argo Workflows
- Docker
- CI/CD pipelines

**Languages**
- Go
- Python
- SQL

## Currently working on

- Data platform migrations and technical debt reduction
- Improving reliability of ingestion and processing pipelines
- Research on techniques for reducing hallucinations in language models

I care about:
- building systems that are reliable under real conditions
- understanding how systems fail
- keeping architectures simple and maintainable
- solving practical problems rather than theoretical ones
